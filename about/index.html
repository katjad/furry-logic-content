                <p>Why do dogs slurp from their drinking
bowls while cats lap up water with a
delicate flick of the tongue? How does a
tiny turtle hatchling from Florida circle
the entire northern Atlantic before
returning to the very beach where it was
born? And how can a Komodo dragon kill
a water buffalo with a bite only as strong
as a domestic cat's?
                </p>
                <p>These puzzles &mdash; and many more besides
&mdash; are all explained by physics. From heat
and light to electricity and magnetism,
Furry Logic unveils the ways that animals exploit physics to eat,
drink, mate and dodge death in their daily
battle for survival.</p>

is a science and
environment writer
based in Bristol,
UK. Fascinated
by animals since a
childhood encounter
with a squashed frog, she is a particular fan
of bats, bees and badgers. After winning
journalism fellowships from the World
Federation of Science Journalists and the
European Geosciences Union, Liz has
also reported on beluga whales in the
Canadian Arctic and Finnish reindeer. She

is editor of the
international
magazine Physics
World, where he enjoys
telling the stories that
underpin physics and
showing how it impacts so much of everyday
life. Based in Bristol, UK, he first became
intrigued by how animals use physics after
publishing a special issue of Physics World on
the subject in 2012. Matin has a degree in
chemical physics and did a PhD and postdoc
squashing food gels at Cambridge University
before moving into publishing. He blogs at <a href="http://www.matindurrani.net/">matindurrani.net</a>.</p>
