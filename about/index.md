about_liz_text: is a science and environment writer based in Bristol, UK. Fascinated
  by animals since a childhood encounter with a squashed frog, she is a particular
  fan of bats, bees and badgers. After winning journalism fellowships from the World
  Federation of Science Journalists and the European Geosciences Union, Liz has also
  reported on beluga whales in the Canadian Arctic and Finnish reindeer. She has a
  materials science degree from Oxford University and a PhD in thin-film diamond.
  She blogs at [lizkalaugher.net](http://lizkalaugher.net).
about_matin_text: is the editor of the international magazine Physics World, where
  he enjoys telling the stories that underpin physics and showing how it impacts so
  much of everyday life. Based in Bristol, UK, he first became intrigued by how animals
  use physics after publishing a special issue of Physics World on the subject in
  2012. Matin has a degree in chemical physics and did a PhD and postdoc squashing
  food gels at Cambridge University before moving into publishing. He blogs at [matindurrani.net](http://matindurrani.net).

Why do dogs slurp from their drinking bowls while cats lap up water with a delicate flick of the tongue? How does a tiny turtle hatchling from Florida circle the entire northern Atlantic before returning to the very beach where it was born? And how can a Komodo dragon kill a water buffalo with a bite only as strong as a domestic cat's?

These puzzles — and many more besides — are all explained by physics. From heat and light to electricity and magnetism, Furry Logic unveils the ways that animals exploit physics to eat, drink, mate and dodge death in their daily battle for survival.
